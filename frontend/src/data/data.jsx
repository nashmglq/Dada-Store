      You can use the arrows to view the two projects I made. I highly recommend checking them out or giving them a try!

      This project actually popped into my head while I was stuDYING for my FeedCon final exam XD.
      It took a bit of time since it was my first time using Postgres and Prisma.
      If you’re also struggling with motivation, I totally recommend trying this project out!`,
